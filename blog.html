                Discuss the scope of var, let, and const
            </div>
            <div class="collapse-content">
                <p>Var: Variables that are declared using var are accessible throughout the function for which they are
                    declared, and they have function scope. Var declarations can also be utilized before they are
                    actually declared in the code since they are hoisted. <br>let: Variables declared with let have
                    block scope, which restricts their visibility to the block in which they are specified. This is
                    different from var. Moreover, make sure statements are accessible only after their point of
                    declaration by not hoisting them. <br> Const: Const offers block scope for variables, much like let.
                    Const, on the other hand, prohibits reassignment following the first assignment, going one step
                    further. The variable's value cannot be altered once set, even though the variable itself is not
                    unchangeable.

                <p>Null: Applied to variables to indicate an intentional lack of value or to properties that are
                    purposefully left without a meaningful value, null is frequently used to represent the explicit
                    absence of any object value. <br>Undefined: This default state, which is automatically assigned to
                    variables that have been declared but not given a value, denotes the lack of a value. It frequently
                    occurs while trying to access properties of nonexistent objects or when functions fail to return a
                    value.</p>

                What do you mean by REST API?
            </div>
            <div class="collapse-content">
                <p>REST API is an architectural style emphasizing stateless communication, where each client request
                    contains all necessary information. Resources, identified by URIs, are manipulated using standard
                    HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE). Representations in formats like JSON or XML facilitate
                    interaction, and the stateless nature of operations ensures each request is independent, enhancing
                    scalability and maintainability.</p>
